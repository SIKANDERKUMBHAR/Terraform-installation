## Installation Steps

### macOS

1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed)**

   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Terraform**

   Use Homebrew to install Terraform:

   ```sh
   brew tap hashicorp/tap
   brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
   ```

### Windows

1. **Download Terraform**

   Download the appropriate package for your system from the [Terraform downloads page](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

2. **Install Terraform**

   - Unzip the downloaded package to a directory of your choice.
   - Move the executable to a directory included in your system's PATH.

   To set the PATH environment variable:

   - Open the Start Search, type in "env", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
   - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
   - In the Environment Variables window, find the Path variable in the "System variables" section, and click "Edit".
   - Click "New" and add the path to the directory where you unzipped Terraform.
   - Click "OK" to save the changes.

### Linux

1. **Add the HashiCorp GPG key**

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
   ```

2. **Add the HashiCorp Linux repository**

   ```sh
   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
   ```

3. **Update and install**

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install terraform
   ```

## Verify Installation

To verify that Terraform has been installed correctly, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```sh
terraform -version
```

You should see output that includes the Terraform version number.
